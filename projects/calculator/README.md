this is my first project
calculator...
i didnt solve any existing problem in it, but yeah
i just cloned it.

it helped me use my js concepts

- document.querySelector, document.querySelectorAll (array)
- forEach
- arrow functions
- addEventListener instead of onclick=""
- .innerHTML
- eval()
- String()
- String.length
- String.slice(i, f);

----------------------

when i click on 9 button, i should update calculation as 9
and i should also update the display along with localStorage
